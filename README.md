## 👨‍💻Tech stack

Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the **BookStore API** uses:

- [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot): provides a set of pre-built templates and conventions for creating stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.
- [Hibernate](https://hibernate.org/): simplifies the interaction between Java applications and databases by mapping Java objects to database tables and vice versa.
- [Spring Security](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/index.html): provides features like authentication, authorization, and protection against common security threats.
- [Spring Web](https://spring.io/projects/spring-ws#overview): includes tools for handling HTTP requests, managing sessions, and processing web-related tasks.
- [Spring Data JPA](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/): provides a higher-level abstraction for working with databases and includes support for JPA (Java Persistence API).
- [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/): helps reduce boilerplate code by automatically generating common code constructs (like getters, setters, constructors, etc.) during compile time.
- [Mapstruct](https://mapstruct.org/): generates mapping code based on annotations, reducing the need for manual, error-prone mapping code.
- [Liquibase](https://www.liquibase.org/): helps manage database schema changes over time, making it easier to track and deploy database updates.
- [Swagger](https://swagger.io/): provides a framework for generating interactive API documentation, allowing developers to understand, test, and use APIs more easily.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/): provides a consistent and reproducible way to deploy applications across different environments.
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/): allows developers to create and send HTTP requests to test APIs, monitor responses, and automate testing workflows.

## ⚡️ Quick start

First, download a [repository][repo_url]. 
You can use git console command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Denis-Balako/Online-Book-Store.git
```

Build a project using **Maven**:
```bash
mvn clean install
```
Then, rise a **Docker** container of your app:
```bash
docker build -t {your-image-name}
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```
That's all you need to know to start! 🎉

## 🧑‍✈️Controllers

- [AuthenticationController](auth_controller): handles user registration and authorization.
- [BookController](book_controller): manages book operations, such as creation, updating, deleting and search.
- [CartController](cart_controller): manages shopping cart state, allows users to add, update, retrieve and delete cart items.
- [CategoryController](category_controller): manages categories, allows admins to create, update, retrieve and delete.
- [OrderController](order_controller): handles order management, creating, updating, deleting and retrieving order history.

## 🧑‍🚀Postman Collection

For easy test, I've created a Postman [collection](Book Store API.postman_collection.json) and [environment](Book store API.postman_environment.json), that includes all user and admin requests.
